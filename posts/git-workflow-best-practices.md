Effective Git workflows are essential for collaborative development. Here are the best practices that will improve your team's productivity and code quality.

## 1. Choose the Right Workflow

### Git Flow

Best for: Large teams, complex projects with scheduled releases

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature develop

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/new-feature
```

### GitHub Flow

Best for: Continuous deployment, smaller teams

```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout -b feature/new-feature main

# Create pull request to main
```

## 2. Commit Message Standards

Use conventional commits:

```bash
# Format: type(scope): description
feat(auth): add user login functionality
fix(api): resolve timeout issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## 3. Branch Naming Conventions

Use descriptive, consistent names:

```bash
# Good examples
feature/user-authentication
bugfix/login-error
hotfix/security-patch
chore/update-dependencies
```

## 4. Code Review Process

- All code must be reviewed before merging
- Use pull/merge requests
- Provide constructive feedback
- Test thoroughly

## 5. Keep History Clean

### Rebase vs Merge

```bash
# Rebase for clean history
git rebase develop

# Merge for preserving context
git merge --no-ff feature-branch
```

### Squash Commits

```bash
# Squash last 3 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

## 6. Use .gitignore Effectively

```gitignore
# Dependencies
node_modules/

# Build outputs
dist/
build/

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
```

## 7. Protect Important Branches

- Enable branch protection rules
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks
- Restrict force pushes

## 8. Regular Maintenance

- Delete merged branches
- Keep dependencies updated
- Archive old repositories
- Regular backups

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't commit directly to main/master
- Avoid large, monolithic commits
- Don't ignore merge conflicts
- Don't push sensitive information

Following these practices will lead to better collaboration, fewer conflicts, and more maintainable code!
