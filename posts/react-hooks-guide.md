React Hooks revolutionized the way we write React components by allowing us to use state and other React features in functional components.

## What are React Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have become the standard way to write React components.

## Most Common Hooks

### useState

The most basic hook for managing state in functional components.

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

### useEffect

Handles side effects in your components, replacing lifecycle methods.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
}, [count]);
```

### useContext

Allows you to consume context values without wrapping components.

```javascript
const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use hooks at the top level of your React function
2. Only call hooks from React functions
3. Use custom hooks to extract component logic
4. Keep your hooks simple and focused

React Hooks make your code more readable and reusable while eliminating the need for class components in most cases.
