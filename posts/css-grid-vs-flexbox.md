CSS Grid and Flexbox are both powerful layout systems, but they serve different purposes. Understanding when to use each is crucial for modern web development.

## CSS Flexbox

Flexbox is designed for **one-dimensional layouts** - either in a row or column.

### Best Use Cases:

- Navigation bars
- Button groups
- Centering content
- Distributing space between items

### Example:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## CSS Grid

Grid is designed for **two-dimensional layouts** - rows and columns simultaneously.

### Best Use Cases:

- Page layouts
- Card layouts
- Complex responsive designs
- Overlapping elements

### Example:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 20px;
}
```

## Key Differences

| Feature         | Flexbox   | Grid |
| --------------- | --------- | ---- |
| Dimension       | 1D        | 2D   |
| Content-first   | Yes       | No   |
| Layout-first    | No        | Yes  |
| Browser Support | Excellent | Good |

## When to Use Which?

- **Use Flexbox** when you need to arrange items in a single row or column
- **Use Grid** when you need to create complex layouts with both rows and columns
- **Use both together** - Grid for the overall layout, Flexbox for components within grid areas

The key is understanding that they complement each other rather than compete!
